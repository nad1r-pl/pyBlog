# Todo File

* detect the users timezone and display date/time formats properly.
* add user login/logout/register functionality, though register should be by
  invitation not open to all. [`PARTIAL`]
* define tag on the body that can wrap the start of the article, which can be
  displayed on the main index page list, followed by a 'read more' button. Can
  do fancy styling to fade the last few lines etc too.
* paginate the first page to say 5 or 10 etc latest post only.
* show a pinned post?
* automatically create a google sitemap.xml on each new post.
* ensure we don't have duplicate slugs. not too difficult in a single-user blog
  but may be more of an issue if multiple users post.
* allow to access posts by /year/month/date/slug also. This will perhaps help
  with the above issue.
